# The Logify Methodology

> "From Guesswork to Certainty"

While most product development processes rely on the gut feeling of "it looks good," we provide the certainty that "it is logically valid" through structured models and logical rules. Our methodology offers a systematic way to transform a team's ambiguous ideas into high-potential design assets.

## Pillar 1: All Design Starts from 'Purpose'.

-   **What we do:** We begin the design process not by asking "What feature should we build?" but with the fundamental question, "Why does this product exist?"
-   **Why it matters:** This ensures that every team member's decision-making is firmly rooted in the most important business goals. It prevents meetings from drifting and stops resources from being wasted on features unrelated to the core mission.

## Pillar 2: We Create a 'Concept Map' from Thoughts.

-   **What we do:** We work with the team to materialize the abstract concepts from each member's mind into a tangible 'Concept Map,' clearly defining the relationships between each concept.
-   **Why it matters:** Planners, designers, and developers finally share the same blueprint. It fundamentally prevents critical failures that arise from comments like, "That's not how I understood it," right from the design stage.

## Pillar 3: We Embed a 'Logical Rule' Safety Device into the Design.

-   **What we do:** We explicitly apply core business rules, such as "To do A, B and C can never exist simultaneously," to the design model itself.
-   **Why it matters:** This acts as a powerful safety device that finds and prevents fatal design flaws that would otherwise only be discovered during development. It transforms design based on guesswork and intuition into the realm of predictable and verifiable engineering.
